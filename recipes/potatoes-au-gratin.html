    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Creamy, cheesy, and indulgent, this potatoes au gratin recipe is perfect
      for holiday meals or any dinner that calls for something special.
    </p>
    <p>
      This wonderful classic potatoes au gratin recipe is one of my go-to
      Thanksgiving side dishes, but it's also perfect for any special dinner. It
      involves layering thinly sliced potatoes with heavy cream and grated
      cheese in a casserole dish, and then baking until the cream thickens and
      blankets the potatoes in a rich, creamy sauce. This dish is definitely
      worthy of a special occasion, but honestly, enjoying this au gratin
      potatoes recipe feels like a special occasion all on its own.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Butter to grease the baking dish</li>
      <li>2½ pounds Russet potatoes (3 to 4), peeled and sliced very thin</li>
      <li>1½ teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 cup (4 oz) finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
      <li>2¼ cups heavy cream</li>
      <li>Fresh thyme, for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350°F and set an oven rack in the middle position.
        Grease an 8-inch (or 2-quart) baking dish with butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl, toss the potatoes with the salt and pepper until
        evenly coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange some of the potato slices, edges overlapping, in a single layer
        on the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle a quarter of the
        cheese over the potatoes, and then pour a quarter of the cream over the
        cheese. Repeat with the remaining potatoes, cheese, and cream, forming 4
        layers. Pour any leftover cream over top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place in the oven and bake, uncovered, for 60 to 75 minutes, or until
        the potatoes are tender when pierced with a knife and golden brown on
        top. Let the dish settle on the counter for about ten minutes. Sprinkle
        with fresh thyme, if using, and then serve.
      </li>
